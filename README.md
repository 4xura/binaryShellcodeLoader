# binaryShellcodeLoader
Recently, I have a demmand for encoding a Linux-cmd-64bit shellcode to bypass some security checks. There are a lot shellcode loaders for Windows machine to generate an executable to run, but rarely for the elf binary in Linux Systyem. So I make a simple framework that generates the final binary with both decoder &amp; shellcode.
